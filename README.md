  # Compile instructions
    Your first time installation of NodeJS:
    1) Install NodeJS: 
    2) npm install -g pkg
    The package which lets you build executables. For each new major build, you'd have to reinstall pkg.

    The building procedure:
    0) Have the source file in a new folder and open Powershell there
    1) npm init -y
    Generates a package.json file
    2) npm install -S child_process chrome-remote-interface atob btoa prompt
    These are all the packages that iBelg's tool uses
    3) Edit the json file, e.g. give it a name, version, don't forget to keep ibelg's name in the author section.
    4) Check which node version you have if you don't know, by using the command: node -v
    4) Inside "Scripts": {} add:
    "build": "pkg main.js --targets node17-win-x64 --compress Brotli --output InjectMenuV1"
    Or depending of what your major node version is, for example 14, you'd of course write node14-win-x64 instead.
    5) Execute: npm run build
```
